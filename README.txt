For now I am not saving the vendor folder to git, the items that need to be installed into the directory:
	"/2DVulkan/vender/**" are:
		AsposeFont
		Freetype
		GLFW
		glm
		imgui
		stb_image
		stb_truetype
		vulkan

Each item is its own folder and each folder has an include folder with all the includes inside except imgui its funny
